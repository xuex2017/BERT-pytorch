The cache_dir saves pretrained model weight.
Must export environment variable PYTORCH_TRANSFORMERS_CACHE to some dir under /capstone to avoid disk storage problem

Call squad.sh
Will not train on train dataset because I commented out lines that do training.
It will directly load pretrained model from cache dir and save to out_dir.

Call predict.sh
Will load model from out_dir and cache_dir, then output prediction.json to out_dir
